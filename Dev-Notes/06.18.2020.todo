Rise With Eden

MVP Rush!

Late night challenge:

  ✔ Finish the TopControl Module with whatever Icons match the best (they'll end up being changed later) @done (20-06-18 03:55)

  ✔  Commit your changes, merge into development, then create new branch called SideBar and add DOM changes through state changes for the buttons @done (20-06-18 03:55)

  ☐  Work on the main content area  (continued from last session) @started(20-06-18 03:55)

    - Ran into a snag here, it turns out that I'm going to have to make the left sidebar buttons onClick="changeTheMode" to whatever that tool box is. Image, Text, Movie, Title etc... I think creating a "mode" prop is the best way to go about it, then you can check against a hierachy state where the mode of the project creation tool is set, and until you unset it you're stuck that way (good thing)
